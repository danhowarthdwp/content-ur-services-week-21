Resources from the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/content-design-and-user-research-meetup-services-week-2021-tickets-142131482089">content design and user research meetup at Services Week 2021</a>. Including slides, links and contact details.

## Lightning talks

We had lightning talks on the interfaces between content design and user research from four amazing speakers.

### Imran Akhtar: content design is making my work better

Imran is ResearchOps manager at the Department for Education (DfE), part of the UK government.


### Peter Smith: top task management during COVID

Peter is chief of product design at Canada.ca for the Canadian government.


### Laura Yarrow: team anthropology

Laura is head of design at HM Land registry, part of the UK government.


### Damien Middleditch: doing content crits

Damien is head of content design at HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), part of the UK government.


## Content crit of a research participant form

Following Damien's talk on how to do a content crit, Lucy offered a new user research participant consent form she's working on at DfE for us to crit. Dom and Dan led the crit, and we fielded comments and suggestions from the audience via Mentimeter and Miro. Because the crit is a safe environment and sometimes contains sensitive information, we're not going to post the outputs here. But we are thinking about how to summarise it, and we'll update this page when we do.

## Other useful links

We discussed a number of books and other useful resources. Here are the details. We have not linked to a website where you can buy the books, but please consider buying them from independent bookshops.
